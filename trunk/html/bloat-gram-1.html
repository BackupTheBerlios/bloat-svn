<H2>GNU true(1)</H2>

<P><TT>Revision 1.25 Mon Jul 18 07:53:05 2005 UTC</TT>. Summary: 82 lines, 2287
bytes of raw bloat.
<PRE>
     1	/* Exit with a status code indicating success.

<P>Well, yes. The very first comment in a file should say what the file is for.
Unless code in it is trivial. Given that GNU people somehow made
<TT>true(1)</TT> a not exactly trivial program, this comment should definitely
stay.

<P>Comment Re: line 1 applies. Unbloated <TT>true(1)</TT> is not copyrightable,
this one certainly is.

<P>Legalese. I wonder if somebody couldn't find a copy of GNU GPL and actually
wrote to FSF. Even out of curiosity.

<P>What a nice idea of code reuse. Reuse because GNU <TT>false(1)</TT> can be
made just a

	#define EXIT_STATUS EXIT_FAILURE

<P>Indeed, having another 2.2K of code which literally does <TT>return 1;</TT>
isn't kosher, so lets abuse C preprocessor.

spec or something similar, it has no right for existence.

<P>Damn right. Ignored command line arguments. <A
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/xcu/true.html">According
to Single Unix Specification, version 2</A>, <TT>true(1)</TT> should ignore
everything. Failure to do so is a bug, because it can be used for substituting
out other commands in scripts, Makefiles, etc.

<P>Now one can argue that a) GNU is not Unix, b) <TT>true(1)</TT> is part of
GNU coreutils package, so why should it be SuS compliant? Indeed, why should
program A be compliant with standard B? The fair answer is "Of course, it
shouldn't... Unless authors of A want to make it compatible with the rest of
the world who <EM>is</EM> compliant with B".

TeX being the first, of course)?
